# Portfolio Scratch Game

## Overview

This project is a fun way to introduce myself. As a developer a portfolio website is a KEY to showcase your projects,and skills. In another way show who you are and what you do. A small-but fun-game where you scratch your way to know more about me.

I built this portfolio using ReactJs as a way to show my front-end skills i have acquired throughout my practicing years as a developer in HTML,CSS,and Vanilla Js and then choosing to learn ReactJs as a Javascript framework. In addition to my front-end skills i practiced many programminng languages and frameworks and used them in building back-end projects such as PHP,SQL, JAVA, C#, PYTHON, and .NET with the help of relational database management systems such as MYSQL and MSSQL.
